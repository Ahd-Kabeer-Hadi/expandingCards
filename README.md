# expandingCards

Explore my Expandable Cards mini-project on GitHub! It's the first of 50 small projects I'm working on to enhance my JavaScript skills. In this project, I've created an interactive and engaging experience using JavaScript to expand and collapse cards. Join me on this coding journey as I continue to learn and refine my programming abilities.
